# Improved Plantard Arithmetic for Lattice-based Cryptography
This repository provides code for our implementations of Kyber and NTTRU using the improved Plantard arithmetic on the Arm Cortex-M4.

The current branch mostly contains code from [Faster Kyber and Dilithium on the Cortex-M4](https://github.com/FasterKyberDilithiumM4/FasterKyberDilithiumM4) and the reference code from [NTTRU: Truly Fast NTRU Using NTT](https://github.com/gregorseiler/NTTRU). The implementations of this branch are based on the Montgomery and Barrett arithmetic. The ``plantard`` branch consists of the code based on the improved Plantard arithmetic presented in ``Improved Plantard Arithmetic for Lattice-based Cryptography`` in TCHES2022-04.

The setup for testing and evaluating of our code is based on the framework provided in the [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4) project.
Detailed instructions on interacting with the hardware and on installing required software can be found in pqm4's readme.
## Prerequisites

- `stm32f4discovery.cfg`: Configuration for openocd in case debugging is desired
- `test.py`: This script is used for building, flashing, and evaluating the outputs produced by `test.c`.

## Usage

The scripts `benchmarks.py`, `f_benchmarks.py`, `stack.py` and `test.py` cover most of the frequent use cases.
In case separate, manual testing is required, the binaries for a scheme can be build using
```
make IMPLEMENTATION_PATH=crypto_kem/{scheme}/{variant} bin/crypto_kem_{scheme}_{variant}_{firmware}.bin
```
, where `firmware` is one of `{test, testvectors, speed, f_speed, stack}` and `variant` is one of `old, new, newstack` (`newstack` only available for Kyber).

It can then be flashed using: 
```
st-flash --reset write bin/crypto_kem_{scheme}_{variant}_{firmware}.bin 0x8000000
```
### Example
For building the `test` firmware for our speed-optimized version of `kyber768` the following command can be used:
```
make IMPLEMENTATION_PATH=crypto_kem/kyber768/new bin/crypto_kem_kyber768_new_test.bin
```
It can the be flashed using:
```
st-flash --reset write bin/crypto_kem_kyber768_new_test.bin 0x8000000
```
